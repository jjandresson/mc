This directory tree contains tests.

auto/

  Tests that don't require the user's intervention. You can run them with
  mcscript.

nonauto/

  Tests that require the user's inspection or interaction. Most of
  them you can run with mcscript. Some require MC (in which case
  just symlink them to your Lua user folder). Read their headers
  to see what they're trying to achieve.

  [comment]
  If, upon restarting MC, you see errors similar to "You can not use
  tty.get_cols() yet, because the UI has not been initialized", this is
  because you symlinked, to your Lua user folder, tests designed for
  mcscript that involve the UI module. If you want these tests to be
  runnable from MC, change the "test()" call (in their source code) to
  something like "keymap.bind('C-whatever', test)".

snippets/

  These aren't "tests" per se. These are snippets you may actually
  find useful. They require MC, so symlink them to your Lua user folder.
  (If it turns out users find a snippet useful, we'd better turn it into
  a module.)

benchmark/

  benchmarking scripts.
