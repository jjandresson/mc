==== Learn Lua integration from others ========

- package "libquvi-scripts"

- VLC

- Ipe

= C =

- Conky's Cairo.

- http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/wxscript/

  "A set of abstract classes to add a script-interpreter support to your
   wxWidgets applications/libraries. The implementation of these interfaces
   for the Lua, Python, UnderC and CINT interpreters (these two are C/C++
   intepreters) are provided. The advantage of a single basic interface
   makes extremely easy for the programmer not only to add scripting
   support to its program but also to give the user multi-scripting
   languages support, learning how to use a single set of powerful classes:
   wxPython, wxLua, wxUnderC and wxCINT. These classes are easily
   extensible and they support Unicode as well."

- wxLua

- https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea    (not Lua)

  "Liferea 1.10+ support GObject Introspection based plugins using
   libpeas. The Liferea distribution comes with a set of Python plugin e.g.
   the media player, GNOME keyring support, a tray icon plugin and maybe
   others."

   http://lzone.de/Writing-Liferea-Plugins-Tutorial-Part-1

     "The important point is: by Liferea using GI (as all GNOME applications
      and many other GTK applications do now) plugins can be written in
      practically any scripting language."


======= Ideas for samples ==========

Fields
  index: show running number (nah! better to print "5/728" at bottom!)
  bm: show "B"/"*" if there are bookmarks/position saved.

Panel
  trash ("safe delete")

      http://forums.bodhilinux.com/index.php?/topic/1098-the-trash-can-command-line-style/
  Warn, using a docked lanel, if the shell has something typed into
    it (see #2110, #213).

Editor
  ^L to also center line in editor.

Environment variables editor?
  "Versions 2.05 and later of bash use a different format for the output of
   the set builtin, designed to make evaluating its output easier. However,
   this output is not compatible with earlier versions of bash (or with
   many other shells, probably)."

General
  A ruler to measure distance (useful in the editor, but also elsewhere).
